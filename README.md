## Introduction

Safebucket is an open-source secure file sharing platform designed to share files in an easy and secure way, integrating
with different cloud providers. Built for individuals and organisations that need to collaborate on files with robust
security, flexible access controls, and seamless support across any S3-compatible provider (including AWS
S3, Google Cloud Storage and [more](https://docs.safebucket.io/docs/configuration/storage-providers)).

## Why Safebucket?

Safebucket eliminates the complexity of secure file sharing by providing a lightweight, stateless solution that
integrates seamlessly with your existing infrastructure.
Plug in your preferred storage and auth providers and eliminate the need for local logins - your users can share files using their
existing corporate identities.

- 🔐 **SSO Integration**: Single sign-on with any/multiple auth providers and manage their sharing capabilities
- 📧 **User Invitation System**: Invite external collaborators via email
- 📊 **Real-Time Activity Tracking**: Monitor file sharing activity with comprehensive audit trails
- ☁️ **Multi-Storage Integration**: Store and share files across any S3-compatible provider (including AWS S3, Google
  Cloud Storage and [more](https://docs.safebucket.io/docs/configuration/storage-providers))
